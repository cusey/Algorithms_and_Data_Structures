## Deque
### Description  
(usually pronounced like "deck") is an irregular acronym of double-ended queue. Double-ended queues are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or contracted on both ends (either its front or its back).

### Programming Notes
I used python build-in list as the Data Structure. The rear of the array is the first element while the front of the array is the last
element. I used the Pop Method to remove elements from front and rear of the array. Passing in a zero in the parameter while remove element from the rear of the array and passing in nothing will remove from the front of the array. To added element to the front of array by using the Append Method. The Insert Method is used to added the the rear of the array.
