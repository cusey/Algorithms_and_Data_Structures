Python Built-in Functions: (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
ord(c) - Given a string representing one Unicode character, return an integer representing the Unicode code 
point of that character. For example, ord('a') returns the integer 97 and ord('â‚¬') (Euro sign) returns 8364.
This is the inverse of chr().

Python list initialization - http://zetcode.com/lang/python/lists/
Sometimes we need to initialize a list in advance to  have a particular number of elements. 
[0]*26 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0 for i in range(26)]  =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The method cmp() compares elements of two lists. (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_cmp.htm ) - Python 3 does not have cmp
"(If you really need the cmp() functionality, you could use the expression (a > b) - (a < b) as the equivalent for cmp(a, b).)"
